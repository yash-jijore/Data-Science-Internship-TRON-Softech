1]🏠 Housing Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project implements an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline to predict median house prices using the California Housing dataset.
It supports both training and inference in a single script and automatically switches modes based on model availability.

📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

Build a robust regression model

Handle data preprocessing automatically

Save and reuse trained models

Predict house prices for new/unseen data

The project uses Random Forest Regression along with Scikit-learn Pipelines to ensure clean, reusable, and production-ready code.






2]✍️ Handwritten Digit Recognition using Neural Network (MNIST)

This project implements a Neural Network–based image classification system to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. It demonstrates an end-to-end deep learning workflow including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction of handwritten digits.

📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

Build a Neural Network classifier for handwritten digit recognition

Load and preprocess the MNIST handwritten digit dataset

Train the model to correctly classify digits from 0 to 9

Evaluate model performance using accuracy metrics

Predict digits from unseen handwritten images
