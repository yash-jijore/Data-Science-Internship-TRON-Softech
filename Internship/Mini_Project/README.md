🏠 Housing Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project implements an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline to predict median house prices using the California Housing dataset.
It supports both training and inference in a single script and automatically switches modes based on model availability.

📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

Build a robust regression model

Handle data preprocessing automatically

Save and reuse trained models

Predict house prices for new/unseen data

The project uses Random Forest Regression along with Scikit-learn Pipelines to ensure clean, reusable, and production-ready code.
